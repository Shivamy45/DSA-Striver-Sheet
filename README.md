## 📂 Folder Structure

Each folder includes:

- ✅ `.cpp` file with clean, well-commented solutions  
- 🧪 `input.txt` and `output.txt` files for sample I/O  
- 📁 Topic folders named like: `t1-cppBasic/`, `t2-patterns/`, etc.

## 🚀 My Goals

- 📅 Solve at least **1-2 problems daily**
- 📚 Master core DSA concepts through hands-on coding
- 🧠 Build deep problem-solving and STL understanding
- 💼 Prepare confidently for **coding interviews**
